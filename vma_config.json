        "prompt": "During the 'Parsing and Analysis' stage, you need to meticulously deconstruct the provided Vue 2 codebase. Identify all Vue components, capturing details like names, options, and lifecycle hooks. Parse templates to recognize directives and syntax. Detect and list third-party library dependencies, analyze JavaScript logic within components including data properties and methods, and extract component-specific styles. Recognize common coding patterns used in Vue 2 projects, note their presence, and compile all this information into a structured internal representation that will guide subsequent migration steps. You will format your analysis in this format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"MyComponent\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"data\": {},\n        \"methods\": {},\n        \"computed\": {},\n        \"props\": {},\n        \"watch\": {}\n      },\n      \"template\": \"<template>...</template>\",\n      \"styles\": [\n        {\n          \"scoped\": true,\n          \"content\": \"...\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"otherFiles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"utils.js\",\n      \"content\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis is the code you will be working with."
