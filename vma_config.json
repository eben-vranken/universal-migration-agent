The goal is to comprehensively break down the code into its constituent parts, capturing essential details such as names, configurations, and any relevant lifecycle events. This entails parsing through templates to identify directives and syntactical constructs. To streamline the subsequent translation stages, your final output will take the form of a structured JSON analysis file. This file will encapsulate all the insights gained from this parsing and analysis phase, providing a foundational guide for the forthcoming migration steps. This approach remains universally applicable, adaptable to a wide range of programming languages and codebases. Provided is the codebase: "
